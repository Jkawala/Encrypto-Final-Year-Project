# Encrypto-Final-Year-Project
Welcome to our digital forensic investigation application, designed to aid in the recovery and analysis of digital evidence. This application includes a file scanner, registry editor, network IP searcher, MD5 converter and calculator, and encryption and decryption tools.  

The file scanner is capable of scanning and recovering deleted files, while the registry editor can analyze registry data. The network IP searcher can search for IP addresses and the MD5 converter and calculator can verify file integrity. The encryption and decryption tools offer secure data transfer.

This application is built with versatility in mind, supporting a variety of file formats and can be used on a wide range of devices. It is designed to be user-friendly with intuitive interfaces that make it easy to use for digital forensic investigations.

This project is open source and contributions are welcome. I encourage you to explore and experiment with our application and hope it proves to be a useful tool in your forensic investigations.
